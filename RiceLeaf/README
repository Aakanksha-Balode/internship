Task 1 :- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2 :- Create a model which can classify the three major attacking diseases of rice plants like leaf blast, bacterial blight and brown spot.

Task 3 :- Analyze various techniques like Data Augmentation, etc and create a report on that.

🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection

Project Overview

Rice leaf diseases reduce crop yield and affect food production.
This project uses Deep Learning and Computer Vision to automatically detect rice leaf diseases from images.

We classify rice leaves into three disease categories using CNN.
