This project analyzes the Portuguese Bank Marketing dataset to understand customer behavior and predict term deposit subscriptions.
Exploratory Data Analysis revealed that call duration, timing of contact, and customer profile strongly influence campaign success,
while repeated calls reduce effectiveness.
After data cleaning, encoding, and preprocessing, multiple classification models were trained and evaluated.
Among them, Random Forest performed best, offering a strong balance between precision and recall despite class imbalance.
Overall, the study shows that combining data-driven insights with targeted,
human-centric marketing strategies can significantly improve campaign outcomes.
